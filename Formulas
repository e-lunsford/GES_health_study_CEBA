Required formulas for analysis include


Equation 1. Estimation of incidence rate per 1,000 live births for low birthweight and preterm birth.
Incidence = Cases / Total * 1,000

Equation 2. Cases of disease and mortality attribuable to air pollution exposure.
Delta-Y = Population * Y0 * (1 - exp(-Beta * Delta-C))

where Y0 is the 5-year average incidence or mortality rate, Delta-C is the difference in 5-year average air pollution concentration between neighborhood of interest and the least exposed neighborhood, Beta is the effect estimate per unit change derived from literature

Equation 3. Beta effect estimates.
Beta = ln(Effect estimate) / Delta-X

where the effect estimate is derived from literature, and Delta-X denotes the per unit change

Equation 4. Conversion calculations between micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) and parts per billion (ppb).
Concentration (ug/m3) = Concentration (ppb) * Molecular Weight / Molecular Volume

Equation 5. Molecular volume.
Molecular volume (L) = 22.41 * T/273 * 1013/P

Where T is absolute pressure in Kelvin, P is atmospheric pressure in hPa. For our calculations we assumed a constant temperature of 25 C (298 K) and pressure of 840 hPa

Molecular weights (g/mol) by air pollutant.
O3 = 48.00, NO2 = 46.01, SO2 = 64.07, CO = 28.01
